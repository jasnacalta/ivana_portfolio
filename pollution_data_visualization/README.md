# Pollution Data Visualization on European Industries

## Project Overview
This project explores the environmental impact of various European industries by visualizing pollution data. The primary objective is to provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders on how different sectors contribute to environmental degradation. The project focuses on:
- Water production and the impact of the **Water Framework Directive**.
- The environmental cost and intensity of each industry, broken down by impact area (e.g., abiotic resources, biodiversity, and human health).

The final output includes an interactive Tableau dashboard for exploring the pollution impact across countries and industries in Europe.

## Key Components:
1. **Data Source**:  
   The dataset is sourced from a study by David Freiberg et al. (2021), which provides metrics on environmental impact across various industries. The data focuses on key environmental indicators like human health, water production capacity, biodiversity, and more.
   
2. **Data Processing**:  
   - **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process was completed using Python, with feature engineering focusing on revenues and industry classification.
   - The final dataset consists of over 4500 entries across various industries in Europe.

3. **Visualization**:  
   The dashboard, built using Tableau, provides:
   - Time-series trends of environmental intensity and cost.
   - Geographic comparisons between different countries in Europe.
   - Breakdown of environmental impact by industry.
   
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To document and run the ETL process.
- **Tableau**: To visualize and explore the data interactively.

## Insights:
- Industries like **Utilities**, **Fossil Fuels**, and **Mining** have the highest negative environmental impacts in terms of water production.
- The environmental intensity trend shows improvement in recent years, but significant challenges remain in key sectors.

## Future Work:
- Expanding the dataset to include more industries and countries.
- Developing more granular insights into sub-industries for detailed policy recommendations.
